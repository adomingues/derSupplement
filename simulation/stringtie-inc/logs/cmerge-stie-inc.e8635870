[Wed Dec  2 19:15:20 2015] Quantitating transcripts
You are using Cufflinks v2.2.1, which is the most recent release.
Command line:
cufflinks -o /dcs01/ajaffe/Brain/derRuns/derSupplement/simulation/stringtie-inc/cuffmerge/ -F 0.05 -g /dcs01/ajaffe/Brain/derRuns/derSupplement/simulation/gtf/chr17-incomplete.gtf -q --overhang-tolerance 200 --library-type=transfrags -A 0.0 --min-frags-per-transfrag 0 --no-5-extend -p 4 /dcs01/ajaffe/Brain/derRuns/derSupplement/simulation/stringtie-inc/cuffmerge/tmp/mergeSam_filepzeEmf 
[bam_header_read] EOF marker is absent. The input is probably truncated.
[bam_header_read] invalid BAM binary header (this is not a BAM file).
File /dcs01/ajaffe/Brain/derRuns/derSupplement/simulation/stringtie-inc/cuffmerge/tmp/mergeSam_filepzeEmf doesn't appear to be a valid BAM file, trying SAM...
